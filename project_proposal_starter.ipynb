When I upload it, it gives me an error). My question is: How does U.S. presidential endorsement by newspapers affect the number of votes. I am curious about if the newspaper affects the number of votes the president nominates get. As a backup, I'll use the endorsement information and try to do something similar.  Maybe see how newspaper endorsement has changed over the years. Have newspapers become more political over the years?</span>"

My next step is to make a function that determines the percentage of newspapers in a given year that supports republicans, democrats, or unknown. This percentage vs time stacked bar graph will be my first data set. My next data set will be the percentage of votes that are republican, democrat, or other. I will make a function that determines the percentage of votes for each party for a given year. I will then graph this as a percentage of republicans per election year line graph. Since America is a two-party system, the percentage of Democrat voters is 100% - the percentage of Republican voters. I want to combine both of these data into one single graph if that is possible. If this is too challenging, I will separate the graphs. a\n",
